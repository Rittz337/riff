riff - Raw Image File Flasher version 0.4.2

=================================================================================
Description:
=================================================================================
A tool for flashing a device.

=================================================================================
Hardware and software requirements:
=================================================================================
NOTE that building the tool requires the following packages to be installed:

libusb-dev-1.0-0 
riff-loadercomm
riff-configpack

NOTE: To use riff on internal development board riff-configpack-internal also 
needs to be installed. To use internal config pack instead of default create a 
symlink to /usr/share/riff/snowball_internal/config in $HOME/.riff/config
$ ln -s /usr/share/riff/snowball_internal/config $HOME/.riff/config

=================================================================================
Usage:
=================================================================================

$ sudo make install

Will build from source and put the binary and lib in /usr/bin/share and /usr/lib/
respectively. It's then possible to run riff from anywhere.

## Configuration file ##
A template config file is provided in the source tree as config/riff.config
It will be renamed and placed in /usr/share/riff/
when using the make install target.

This file can be overridden with a user-specific config file placed in 
$HOME/.riff, or by providing a full path to a config file at 
runtime, as option on the command line (using the -c option).

riff will look for configuration file to use in the following order:
1) Config file provided on command line (using the -c option) at runtime.
2) Config file in user's home directory ($HOME/.riff/config)
3) /usr/share/riff


## Running ##

Usage: riff [OPTION]...[FILE]...

 Available command line arguments are:

   -h, --help				Display this help message.
   -m, --mode ACTION			Select the mode.
 					ACTION is `flash` or `erase`
   -c, --config PATH			Give path to configuration file.
   -f, --flashimage IMAGEPATH		Give path to flashimage.
   -a, --address FLASHADDR		Give a start address in hex.
   -l, --length HEXLENGTH		Length of the dump [Byte] in hex.
   -d, --dumppath DUMPPATH		File path on PC where to store dump.
   -v, --verbose			Shows more detailed information.
       --version			Shows version information.

Examples:

$ riff -f <path/to/flashimage>

Default mode 'flash' will be used, and configuration originally from config/riff.config
but put in /usr/share/riff will be used (if the user hasn't overridden this file
by its own in $HOME/.riff/config).
The flashimage at the provided path will be flashed onto the device starting at address 0.

To start at any other address than 0, use

$ riff -f <path/to/flashimage> -a <address>

WARNING:
NOTE THAT RIFF HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER YOU ARE OVERWRITING IMPORTANT
SECTIONS ON YOUR DEVICE OR NOT WHEN FLASHING! THE TOOL DOES NOT WARN YOU OR 
PREVENT YOU FROM PROVIDING ANY ADDRESS TO FLASH TO. 
In other words: it's up to you to know what you're doing, the tool takes no 
responsibility for it!

Path to flashimage can also be specified in the config file and the -f flag
can then be omitted.


Build from source without installing:
$ make 

riff binary ends up in riff directory. To run, libcdal (located in CDAL
directory) must be then be added to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
